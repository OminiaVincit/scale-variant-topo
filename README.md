## Generate synthetic network data

We describe source code used in our experiments to generate network data from network models.

### gen-networks/gen_girvan_newman.m (Matlab)
Generate networks from Girvan-Newman network model.

    Number of nodes N = 128
    Four communities of size 32 and the average degree of 16.
    p_in, p_out: the probability of intra-community and inter-community links.
    r = p_out/p_in = 0.01, 0.02,..., 1.0

### gen-networks/gen_WS.m (Matlab)
Generate networks from Watts-Strogatz model.

    Number of nodes N = 128
    Rewiring probability beta = 0.00, 0.01,..., 1.0

### gen-networks/gen_erdos_renyi.m (Matlab)
Generate networks from Erdos-Renyi model.

    Number of nodes N = 128
    The pair-link probability p_link = 0.020, 0.021,..., 0.1

### gen-networks/gen_SP.m (Matlab)
Generate networks from Sales-Pardo model.

    Number of nodes N = 640 nodes
    Three community structures nested in one another.
        64 communities of 10 nodes at the small-scale level, 
        16 communities of 40 nodes at the medium-scale level,
        4 communities of 160 nodes at the large-scale level.
    The average degree k_bar = 16
    The separations between the three scales: rho = 0.05, 0.10,..., 2.0 


## Real-world network data

For the classification task, we test on ten real-world network datasets of 
bioinformatics and social networks. 
We save these datasets into two format-types *_adj.mat (adjacency matrix) and *.graphml file
(see folder real-networks/{dataname}).

The first dataset is MUTAG; 
it consists of 188 networks of chemical compounds divided into two classes according to 
their mutagenic effect on a bacterium, 
i.e. mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds.

BZR, COX2, DHFR datasets consist of 405 ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR), 
467 cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX2) and 756 inhibitors 
of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) come with 3D coordinates.
In each of these datasets, the chemical compounds are divided into 
active and inactive compounds that we need to classify.

FRANKENSTEIN is a modified version of BURSI
dataset made of 4337 molecules with 2401 mutagens and 1936 nonmutagens to classify.
Each molecule is represented as a small network whose vertices are 
labelled by the chemical atom symbol and edges by the bond type.

PROTEINS is a dataset of 1113 proteins represented as networks, 
where the nodes are secondary structure elements and the edges represent 
the neighbourhood within the 3-D structure or along the amino acid chain. 
We classify the proteins into enzymes and non-enzymes.

NCI1 and NCI109 are datasets of chemical compounds with 4110 and 4127 compounds, respectively. 
We classify the compounds with the ability to suppress or inhibit 
the growth of a panel of human tumour cell lines.

IMDB--BINARY is a dataset of 1000 movie collaboration ego-networks for 
each actor (actress) in Action and Romance genres from IMDB.com.
For each network, two nodes representing actors or actresses 
are connected if they appear in the same movie.
The task is to identify whether a given ego-network of 
an actor (actress) belongs to the Action or Comedy genre.

IMDB--MULTI is the multi-class version of IMDB--BINARY 
and contains 1500 ego-networks belonging to Comedy, Romance and Sci-Fi genres.

## Compute diffusion distance matrix from the network

###  generate_diffusion_mat.py (Python)

Generate diffusion distance matrix from network adjency matrix.

    Options:
            --matpath : input directory consisting of the collection of adjency matrices

                nodes_*_index_{}_adj.nse  --> for LFR, LFR-H networks )
            --outpath : output directory to save diffusion matrices
                (*.npy file with matrix size of K x N x N, K: number of tau, N: number of nodes)
            --normflag : normalize (=1) the diffusion matrix by its maximum element or not
            --avgflag  : average (=1) the diffusion matrix for K values of tau or not
            --idxbg    : start index of adjency matrices file to divide in multi processing
